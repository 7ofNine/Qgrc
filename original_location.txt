BE AWARE!

The locations of the files the in the source tree are not the loctaions of the files where they belong in the 
original gnuradio source tree. They have to be transfered accordingly and properly integrated into the gnuradio
CMAKE build process in order to be used as replacement for the original sources.
These sources don't represent a fully functional gnuradio software system just a gnuradio-companion basis. They are only intended to adapt the gnuradio-companion 
to a more modern and easier to modify/use Qt implementation instead of using a Gtk version. 
The actual corresponding gnuradio version can be found in the https://github.com/7ofNine/gnuradio QT branch

The file gnuradio-companion.py is not existant in the source tree. It is generated from the 
file gnuradion-companion in the folder

...\gnuradio\grc\scripts

There is also generated the file gnuradio-companion.exe
