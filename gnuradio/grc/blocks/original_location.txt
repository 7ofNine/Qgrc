The original location in the gnuradio source tree is
\...\grc\blocks

For easy testing without building (temporarily at least) the whole gnuradio tree copy these *.yaml files
to <user>\.grc_gnuradio
This allowss a simple configuration to go through.


Remark:
There are three types of *.yaml blocks characterrized by the syntax *.xxxx.yaml.
for
xxxx:
block: normal blocks
domain: doamin descriptor
tree: block tree descriptor

this loads corresponding loaders
